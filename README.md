### ðŸ¤” How to use it?

#### 1. Events triggering new shapes

Resizing of window or moving mouse over the canvas.

#### 2. Rate of production of new particles

Edit the spawnRate at the top of CanvasUtils.js. Parameter range is 0 to 10 [0 is no spawning, 10 is the fastest rate].

#### 3. Adding new shapes

Shapes are represented as properties of the drawShape object in CanvasUtils.js. Just follow the example of the existing shapes to add a new one. Shapes are randomly selected during the spawning process.
